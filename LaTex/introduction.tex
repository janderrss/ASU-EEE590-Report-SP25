\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The objective of this document is to provide a detailed derivation of the impedance characteristics of monofilar cylindrical helices predicted by the sheath helix model, which was first proposed by Ollendorf in 1926 \cite{ollendorf}. The work begins by reviewing the fundamental electromagnetic concepts and assumptions which underly the model and proceeds through a step-by-step derivation, informed by the abundant literature describing and extending this modeling approach \cite{rudenberg1, pierce1, kogan1, sensiper_thesis, poritsky1, bryant1, stark1, sichak1, sensiper1, watkins1, fano1, collin1, bondar1, vizmuller1, corum1, corum2}.
