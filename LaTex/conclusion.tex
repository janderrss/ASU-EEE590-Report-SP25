\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This work presents an exhaustive derivation and presentation of the sheath helix model for helical coils. A detailed field analysis is performed and the effective characteristic impedance of a helical coil suitable for transmission line analysis is demonstrated.
